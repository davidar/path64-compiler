 *
 * Type mapping
 *
 * The following type names are to be used in general to avoid host
 * dependencies.  Two sets are provided.  The first, without a prefix,
 * specifies a minimum bit length for the object being defined of 8,
 * 16, or 32 bits.  It is to be interpreted as a host-efficient type
 * of at least that size.  The second, with a "m" prefix, also gives
 * a minimum bit length, but that bit length is preferred (minimizing
 * memory usage is the priority) if remotely reasonable on the host.
 * The latter types should be used only for objects which will be
 * replicated extensively.
 *
